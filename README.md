## Introduction:
 
The Game of Mines is a modern take on the classic Minesweeper concept, a grid-based game that challenges players to find hidden gems while avoiding dangerous mines The fun and simplicity of the game drives the game, it relies on chance, creating a happy balance of risk and reward. As digital gaming has evolved, many games like Minesweeper have remained popular due to their straightforward design and ability to engage players of all ages.


## Motivation:

Our primary motivation for developing Game of Mines was to create a game which is fun and educational. During our search for such games, we looked at the classic games that entertained us in the past, and Minesweeper from Windows 7 got here to thoughts as an iconic recreation of logic, chance, and danger. We wanted to capture the same excitement and simplicity of Minesweeper even as exploring methods to decorate it with current hardware elements. So, we wanted to renovate the game into a hardware game.


## BRIEF IDEA:

The game of mines is a chance-based game often played in gambling events, where players select boxes to uncover safe spots while avoiding the hidden bombs. The objective is to design a circuit that randomly selects one of the spots as bomb and implement a system that allows the user to enter their choices of spots and check if the bomb is in that spot. The user loses if he selects a spot with the bomb or else the user will win if he chooses all the spots without the bomb.

## APPROACH:

1. Use a random number generator circuit to select random spots in which bombs will be placed.
2. Then we will use D flip-flops to represent each of the spots.
3. Then we will implement a multiplexer system to allow player to select spots and the output will decide whether the chosen spot is safe or not.
4. Then a counter will be used to determine whether the user has given input to all the spots other than the ones with bombs.
