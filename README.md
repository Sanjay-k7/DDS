## Motivation:

Our primary motivation for developing Game of Mines was to create a game which is fun and educational. During our search for such games, we looked at the classic games that entertained us in the past, and Minesweeper from Windows 7 got here to thoughts as an iconic recreation of logic, chance, and danger. We wanted to capture the same excitement and simplicity of Minesweeper even as exploring methods to decorate it with current hardware elements. So, we wanted to renovate the game into a hardware game.


## PROBLEM STATEMENT:

The Game of Mines is a modern take on the classic Minesweeper concept, a grid-based game that challenges players to find hidden gems while avoiding dangerous mines. The fun and simplicity of the game drives the game, it relies on chance, creating a happy balance of risk and reward. As digital gaming has evolved, many games like Minesweeper have remained popular due to their straightforward design and ability to engage players of all ages.

## FEATURES:

1. Use a random number generator circuit i.e,Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) to select random spots in which bombs will be placed.

2. Then we will use D flip-flops to represent each of the spots.

3. Then we will implement a multiplexer system to allow player to select spots and the output will decide whether the chosen spot is safe or not.

4. Then a counter will be used to determine whether the user has given input to all the spots other than the ones with bombs.
